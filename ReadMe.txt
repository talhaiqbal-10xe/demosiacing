Dadda Code generator

The main file is 'dadda_code_generator'

operands = number of addition terms
bitwidth = bitwidth of numbers to be added
qBits = bitwidth of multiplicand
pBits = bitwidth of muiltiplier
AorM = Adder or Multiplier selection (AorM ==1) ==>adder (AorM==0) ==> multiplier

The code is compressing an addition tree as well as a multiplication tree.
Both are independent from each other and one can be commented. 
file name are to written manually in the last section of the code.
